# Trie-Based Autocomplete Search Bar

This repository contains the implementation of an autocomplete search bar using a trie data structure. The project demonstrates efficient search and suggestion mechanisms typically used in search engines and input fields in various applications.

## About The Project

The autocomplete search bar is built using a trie (prefix tree) to store a large dataset of words/phrases for quick retrieval. This data structure allows for efficient search and auto-suggestion features, significantly enhancing user experience by predicting the rest of a word or phrase as the user types.
